     <h1>Gummies special abiility</h1>
     <p>When needed Gummy can go invisible for 3 whole seconds. Gummy has used this to his advantage since birth and has allowed him to take on just about any animal. By removing his presence he can sink his jaws into any attacker before they can even know whats going on. This was the best thing that happened to him because he always had a hard time catching fish before finding out about this ability. Now he can eat as many fishes as he wants and when he wants</p>

     	<p> Gummy doesn't originate from anywhere in particular except i used the idea of a mystical forest from a book I read many years ago called FableHeaven. It isn't particularly special to me but there is the part when the two main characters get lost in the forest that I never forgot over the years
